# Koin Inventory Management Web App

Todos:
- Fix CSS styling methods
- Image sizing
- Right now transaction listing only gets Zen's transactions. Change to get using token.
- Make transaction listing responsive, sorting allowed
- Fix sidebar anchor links to move slowly and show header. Not working cause Scrollchor within Sidebar. Also
	Hack of creating extra category hidden under navbar. CHANGE this sidebar implementation - its weird
- Horizontal scrolling prevented using overflowX: hidden in listInventory.js This good?
- Item descriptions need to be limited or else destroys row alignment
- Item gallery setting items using this.items = []; better way?
- Clean up code using npm start warnings
- Remove all print statements
- Some warning about set state in transactions. I think not using componentDidMount properly
- Add ability to confirm or remove the pictures uploaded on add item page

Major sections left:
- Home page shoing lates activities
